# NLP_Unsupervised_Clustering_of_Election_Tweets
This repository contains the data and code used in a Natural Language Processing project involving the k means clustering of TF-IDF scores of tweets related to the 2016 Presidential Election. The data was collected from [data.world](https://data.world/alexfilatov/2016-usa-presidential-election-tweets). the NLTK python package was used for the preprocessing of the corpus, and sklearn was used for the calulation of TF-IDF scores, conducting the clustering, and dimensionality reduction for graphing.

The notebook will need to be run via a virtual machine. Google Colab is recommended. 

A detailed description of the project can be found in the 'Report.pdf' file.
